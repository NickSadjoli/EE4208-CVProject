# EE4208 CV-Project 

Version 0.1 of CV System.

First 'working version of CV system. Things to note: 
1. Training needs to get pictures with white background. Otherwise too much background noise will affect recognition performance. 
2. Different angles and movement will affect recognition for now. Need to make sure that this can be minimized.
3. Haven't tried with more faces per person. Might lead to increase in accuracy. Need to be tested.
